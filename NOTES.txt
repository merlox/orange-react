In the breadcrumbs CSS, when you have the Back button activated and you change the color of all the breadcrumbs with the class="breadcrumbs--color-{color}", the Back button arrow stays grey instead of getting that color.

At the bottom of the page https://orangecss.com/docs/components/custom/avatar, in the table, in the last "Possible values" column, you have a text that says "See Colors page". When you click on "Colors", it goes to a 404 page which is: https://orangecss.com/colors instead of the right one: https://orangecss.com/docs/global

Same thing happens with the links in the table at the end of the Button page: https://orangecss.com/docs/components/basic/button
